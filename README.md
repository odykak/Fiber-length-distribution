# Fiber-length-distribution

Reads fiber length data and, in a new folder, plots:

- length histograms
- normal distribution of observed lengths

"Fiber length distribution" is the file to run, found in the branch named "main".

All data can be found in the branch named "Data".

Created graphs can be found in the branch named "Graphs".

Make sure to adjust the paths in the code. Also, code works just for the exact file/folder names and data for fiber length, saved in more than one "shorter" csv files (see data).
